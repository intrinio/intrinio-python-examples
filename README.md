# Overview

This repository includes sample scripts written in Python using the [Intrinio Python SDK](https://github.com/intrinio/python-sdk) or [websocket examples](https://product.intrinio.com/financial-data/iex-intraday-stock-prices/documentation/python).

It is intented to help data scientists, developers, and quantitative researchers to get started using [Intrinio's](https://github.com) financial data sets via [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), Google's environment for collaboratively running Jupyter Notebooks. 

# Getting Started

You will need to input an Intrinio API Key into the scripts, they are availible for free once you [create an Intrinio account](www.intrinio.com). 

Intrinio offers a free sandbox allowing any user to pull data for Dow 30 companies. Paid plans allow users to access real time stock prices, US Fundamentals, analyst estimates, and more. 

Once you have your API key, navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/github/

Colab will prompt you to authenticate with Github using your gmail account. Once you do, search for this repository, 'intrinio/intrinio-python-examples'

# Running Your First Script in Colab
When you find this repo in Colab click on the script titled 'environment_variable_set_up.ipynb'

It will launch a jupyter notebook file in Colab. You can follow the instructions in the script which will show you how to create an environment file in your google drive where you can store and access your environment variables. Save your Intrinio API key as an environment variable.

# Running Other Scripts
Once you get you are comfortable with setting up your environment variables you can navigate back to https://colab.research.google.com/github/ and open a different sample script. You will be able to run any of them that your API keys have access to. 

# Saving Scripts Locally
